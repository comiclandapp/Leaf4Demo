# Leaf 4 - demo website

Purpose of this website is to provide examples of Leaf templating engine as a complement to [official documentation](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/leaf/getting-started).

It's powered by [Vapor framework](https://vapor.codes) and obviously [Leaf](https://github.com/vapor/leaf). Native dark mode support is provided by tailwind.css.
